[mod-setting-description]
epr_formula_factor=Productivity technology cost for infinite levels is equal to FACTOR ^ L * BASE.
epr_formula_base=Productivity technology cost for infinite levels is equal to FACTOR ^ L * BASE.
epr_formula_minimum=Productivity technologies will always cost at least this amount (relevant for early levels in case there are many tiers/levels).
epr_finite_tech_scaling=How should the costs of the first levels of productivity technologies scale (before the infinite, final stage)?
epr_finite_tech_scaling_custom=Enter a custom cost for each tier (i.e., science pack configuration, not level), separated by forward slash. Make sure to include enough entries, e.g., "50/100/200/300/800/1100". This setting will be ignored unless "Custom" is chosen above.
epr_levels_per_tier=How many levels will be generated for one tier (i.e., science pack configuration). E.g., if you set this to 5, you'll get 5 levels with automation & logistic science packs before the first level that also requires chemical science packs.
epr_productivity_per_level=How much bonus productivity should each level generate (in percent).
epr_infinite_tech=Should productivity technologies be infinite? Overrides maximum level setting.
epr_max_level_value=If productivity technologies are set to infinite, this is ignored. Otherwise this determines the maximum level of the technology, i.e., the maximum productivity will be level * 10% (capped at 300%, unless changed by mods).
epr_minimum_science_pack=The first level of each productivity technology will start with this science pack and all below, unless unlocking the item already requires additional science packs.
epr_maximum_science_pack=The last (=infinite) level of each productivity technology will need all science packs up to this value, unless unlocking the item requires additional science packs.
epr_skip_military=Should military science packs be ignored unless explicitly part of the prerequisites? This is default behaviour for any non-military infinite science.
epr_skip_utility=Should utility science packs be ignored unless explicitly part of the prerequisites? This is default behaviour in Space Age, but not the base game.
epr_formula_factor_science=Science pack productivity technology cost for infinite levels is equal to FACTOR ^ L * BASE.
epr_formula_base_science=Science pack productivity technology cost for infinite levels is equal to FACTOR ^ L * BASE.
epr_formula_minimum_science=Productivity technologies will always cost at least this amount (relevant for early levels in case there are many tiers/levels).
epr_finite_tech_scaling_science=How should the costs of the first levels of productivity technologies scale (before the infinite, final stage)?
epr_finite_tech_scaling_custom_science=Enter a custom cost for each tier (i.e., science pack configuration, not level), separated by forward slash. Make sure to include enough entries, e.g., "50/100/200/300/800/1100". This setting will be ignored unless "Custom" is chosen above.
epr_levels_per_tier_science=How many levels will be generated for one tier (i.e., science pack configuration). E.g., if you set this to 5, you'll get 5 levels with automation & logistic science packs before the first level that also requires chemical science packs.
epr_productivity_per_level_science=How much bonus productivity should each level generate (in percent).
epr_infinite_tech_science=Should science pack productivity technologies be infinite? Overrides maximum level setting.
epr_max_level_value_science=If science pack productivity technologies are set to infinite, this is ignored. Otherwise this determines the maximum level of the technology, i.e., the maximum productivity will be level * 10% (capped at 300%, unless changed by mods).
epr_minimum_science_pack_science=The first level of each science pack productivity technology will start with this science pack and all below, unless unlocking the item already requires additional science packs.
epr_maximum_science_pack_science=The last (=infinite) level of each science pack productivity technology will need all science packs up to this value, unless unlocking the item requires additional science packs.
epr_skip_military_science=Should military science packs be ignored in science pack productivity technologies unless explicitly part of the prerequisites?
epr_skip_utility_science=Should utility science packs be ignore in science pack productivity technologies unless explicitly part of the prerequisites?
epr_adjust_existing_techs=Should existing productivity technologies (steel plate, processing units, etc.) be adjusted to follow the same progression as technologies added by this mod?
epr_choose_recipes=By default, the mod scans only for recipes that allow productivity ("intermediates"). But you can include other types of recipes, too. If a mod changes which recipes allow productivity, this mod will count them as intermediates, too.
epr_remember_intermediate=Some mods change all recipes to allow for productivity which means that this mod will generate technologies for all items, even if you select "Intermediates". If you enable this flag, this mod will try to cache a list of intermediates at the start, before other mods modify them. However, this is not fool-proof and will leave out most modded content, which needs to be added manually via whitelist.
epr_include_recycling_recipes=By default, recycling recipes do not generate any productivity techs. If enabled, you will get a lot of strange technologies. The Space Age recycling productivity technology is not affected.
epr_include_infinite_recipes=By default, recipes that require no inputs (e.g. biter egg generation) will be ignored when generating productivity technologies.
epr_include_hidden_recipes=By default, recipes that are hidden will be ignored as you cannot use them anyway.
epr_blacklist_item=List all items and fluids that should be ignored when scanning recipes, separated by comma. They might still show up if they are the secondary result of a recipes that is not ignored.
epr_blacklist_recipe=List all recipes that should be ignored when scanning, separated by comma. Their products might still generate productivity techs if they can also be created with a different recipe.
epr_whitelist_item=List all items and fluids (separated by comma) whose recipes should be explicitly added, even when other settings would prevent them from being added (e.g., hidden, non-intermediate, etc.).
epr_whitelist_recipe=List all recipes (separated by comma) which should be explicitly added, even when other settings would prevent them from being added (e.g., hidden, non-intermediate, etc.). If an item has multiple recipes, list all, or add it to the item whitelist instead.
epr_verbose=Enables verbose logging during startup (no logging at runtime). Helps with debugging problems, but can also spam the log file.
