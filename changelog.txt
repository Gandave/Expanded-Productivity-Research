---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.1
Date: 18.06.2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Added check to prevent crash when adjusting productivity techs for recipes without results.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 18.06.2025
  Major Features:
    - Added option to "cache" intermediates. If a mod modifies the "allow_productivity" property of recipes, activate this to attempt to mark recipes before they get changed so that the "intermediates only" option will still (more or less) correctly recognize which items are intermediates, rather than adding all recipes/items.
	- Added setting to determine the science cost scaling of the non-infinite levels of each productivity technology or set a custom price for each level.
  Minor Features:
    - Added functionality to ignore outputs that are not affected by productivity ("ignored_by_stats"). If a recipe has no outputs which allow for productivity, the recipe is ignored as the productivity tech would be useless.
    - Added setting to determine the amount of productivity each level of technology provides (default 10%).
  Changes:
    - Setting "overwrite blacklist" removed. Instead, the hardcoded list is set as default value (remember to adjust the value if upgrading from previous versions).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.4
Date: 13.06.2025
  Minor Features:
    - Added whitelist settings to explicitly add items or recipes.
	- Added "no recipe" preset for the rare case where you want only select technologies being generated.
  Bugfixes:
    - Blacklist is now actually correctly parsed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.3
Date: 12.06.2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when existing productivity technologies use count instead of count formula (forgot one case last time).
	- Fixed crash when adjusting existing productivity technologies creates an unresearchable technology (no valid lab).
	- Fixed crash with More Long Inserters due to inserters being removed by the mod.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2
Date: 12.06.2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when existing productivity technologies use count instead of count formula.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 12.06.2025

    - Added setting to allow recipes without inputs to generate techs.
    - Added setting to allow hidden recipes to generate techs.
    - Added setting to allow barrelling recipes to generate techs.
    - Added setting to allow recycling recipes to generate techs.
  Changes:
    - Recipes without any inputs (e.g. biter eggs) will now be ignored by default.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when existing productivity technologies where generate with only a single level.
    - Fixed crash when minimum and maximum science packs were set to "One planetary science".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 11.06.2025
  Features:
    - Added setting to allow multiple levels per "tier" of science.
    - Added functionality to smoothen out the science pack costs before the final level.
  Changes:

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed tech grouping for traffic bollard from Dectorio.
    - Fixed tech grouping for steel processing from 5dim.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.2
Date: 03.06.2025
  Minor Features:
    - Added compatibility with Space Age without Space (science pack progression).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.1
Date: 03.06.2025
  Minor Features:
    - Added better grouping of dectorio recipes.
    - Added better grouping of 5dim turret recipes.
  Changes:
    - Split landfill, concrete and foundation productivity.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash on startup with mod Cerys enabled.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 02.06.2025
  Features:
    - Hidden recipes are now ignored.
    - Added setting to apply productivity techs to all recipes, not just intermediates. Configurable.
    - Added functionality to group productivity techs for machine types (e.g. all assembling machines into one).
    - Added compatibility with 5dims mods.
  Changes:
    - Removed utility science as a requirement for recipe categories (aside from regular progression if flag is set).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.7
Date: 28.05.2025
  Minor Features:
    - Restructured the code that checks for requirements to improve startup time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.6
Date: 26.05.2025
  Minor Features:
    - Added setting to reduce logging in order to accelerate startup.
  Bugfixes:
    - Added Muluna, Moon of Nauvis as optional dependencies to avoid game freezing at start.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
Date: 24.05.2025
  Minor Features:
    - Added compatibility with Age of Production.
    - Added compatibility with mods that allow productivity for entity recipes (e.g. crafting Assembling Machines).
  Bugfixex:
    - Fixed error when item has an icon with size unequal to 64.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
Date: 23.05.2025
  Features:
    - Added new setting: exactly one planetary science. It will pick the most prevalent pack if multiple candidates exist.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash on startup due to duplicate technology requirements.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
Date: 23.05.2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash on startup without Space Age.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 22.05.2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Added optional dependencies
    - Fixed crash on start when mods add new science packs. Progression is still not working unless explicitly added.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 21.05.2025
  Minor Features:
    - Added support for More Asteroids, Forked

    - Adjusted productivity technologies are infinite again (damn typo)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 18.05.2025
  Features:
    - Automatically scans for existing productivity research (not sure about modded technologies, however).
    - Automatically scans for recipes that allow productivity.
    - Creates new technologies for items with productivity for all their recipes with a progression similar to mining productivity.
    - Progression can be configured in the settings.
    - Progression can also be applied to already existing productivity technologies.
    - Science packs use a separate progression track.
